    Title: Cover (Web)Letter for WordPress VIP Technical Account Manager Position
    Author: Dylan Meyer

    Description: I got the idea to build a web page as a portion of my application originally from Episode 17 of the Distributed podcast. It 
    seemed like a fun project to showcase my skills and help me stand out, so I decided to take it on. I must also give credit to Spen Taylor 
    (github.com/spen/hello-automattic) who, with a very open-source mentality, posted his HTML code to GitHub after his successful Automattic 
    application. All of the content and CSS styling is my own, but these were both sources of inspiration. In the end, I found that this project
    helped me organize my thoughts and produce an improved final product.

    FUN FACT: The top-level of this website (www.themeyergroup.org) was build by my dad back in the late 90s (how far we've come!). He was an 
    early PC and internet pioneer from San Diego, before it was cool, who eventually made his living as self-employed a website designer and 
    administrator.

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="panel-body">
        <h1>Hi Automattic!</h1>
        <p class="first">
            I am <u>so</u> excited to submit this application to become a Technical Account Manager (TAM) at WordPress VIP!
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided to build this "cover site," to supplement my traditional cover letter, because I find the latter approach stale and know 
            I have more to offer. I spent over 150 hours learning WordPress, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during the past two months, and was 
            eager for this opportunity to apply what I had learned. I opted to build this site from scratch, as opposed to using WordPress, 
            merely because it would be challenging and require more coding on my part to look and feel great!
        </p>
        <p>
            I also found that using a webpage aided me in organizing my thoughts and focusing on what is important: communicating with my audience. 
            In the sections below, I discuss the following:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How I became enamored with Automattic and why I want to work for you.</li>
                <li>Why I would fit in well with Automattic's culture and vision.</li>
                <li>What I view as my most critical skills for this position.</li>
                <li>How I will immediately contribute to VIP.</li>
                <li>And a bit more background on what makes me . . . me!</li>
            </ul>
        <p class="last">
            In the end, I hope to provide you with a well-rounded perspective of who I am, what I'm capable of, and why I would be a fantastic 
            asset to Automattic. Without further ado, I invite you to expand the panels below and explore. Enjoy!

                <p class="first">
                    About a year ago, I decided that I needed a career-change and embarked on a long and interesting journey that included
                    making it to the final interviews for the <a href="https://careers.state.gov/work/foreign-service/officer/" target="_blank">
                    U.S. Foreign Service</a>, earning my <a href="https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp" target="_blank">
                    Project Management Professional</a> (PMP) certification, and interviewing a diverse set of industry leaders. After 
                    researching Automattic extensively (with input from Klaus Harris) and speaking with Shannon Swenson at length, I knew that I 
                    wanted to be an Automattician. Your organizational culture and your employees' warmth, dedication, and competence are 
                    inspiring and the TAM position offers unique and exciting opportunities in both work responsibilities and clientele.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    The Organization
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Automattic's culture, rooted in transparency and integrity, and vision of extending publishing and commerce tools 
                    globally, inspire thousands of people around the world to volunteer to help the movement. In addition, you empower 
                    people, employees, volunteers, and customers in their work and provide them with the autonomy to pursue interesting 
                    problems. These attributes alone set Automattic apart from most other technology companies of comparable success and have 
                    convinced me that, by working for you, I would be able to make a tangible and positive impact on the world.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    The People
                </h3>
                <p>
                    As may not surprise you, your employees and volunteers are prolific and candid in their descriptions of life as 
                    Automatticians. Much of what I have learned has come from the WordPress Slack instance, community forums, and individual 
                    blogs. I've also thoroughly enjoyed Matt's podcast, <i>Distributed</i>, as a window into every facet of distributed work. 
                    What is immediately clear is that Automattic honors and empowers its people and that the community members care deeply about 
                    each other. Who wouldn't want to be a part of that?
                </p>
                <h3>
                    The Position
                </h3>
                <p class="last">
                    On top of joining a great organization and getting to work with intelligent, driven, and empathetic colleagues, the TAM 
                    position offers an exciting set of clients and responsibilities. I thrive under pressure and purpose and would relish the 
                    opportunity to collaborate with business leaders around the world on complex, interesting problems. It's also clear that 
                    work will never be linear or stagnant as every customer account and internal project is unique and brings with it 
                    the opportunity to learn and grow. That combination: incredible clients, engaging problems, and continual learning, is 
                    exactly what I seek in a career.

                    At first glance, my experience in software development, geology, and academic research suggests that I am primarily a 
                    scientist and engineer (not a bad thing!). While my strong technical background is undeniable, it does not define me. For 
                    the past 14 years, I've thrived in a diverse set of roles that have honed my interpersonal skills, made me an amiable and 
                    reliable colleague, and afforded me unique global and distributed experience. Automattic's combination of highly 
                    collaborative work and a globally dispersed workforce makes these essential skills for every employee.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Empathetic
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I gained abundant managerial and leadership experience as a resident advisor (RA) for three years in college. My most taxing, 
                    but most rewarding, responsibility was addressing points of conflict arising between dorm residents. In my second year as 
                    an RA, I received complaints about a resident exhibiting disconcerting social behavior, including comments suggesting violent 
                    intent. I assured my concerned residents that I would investigate further. After a meeting with my supervisor, I learned that 
                    the resident had been previously diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome and was consulting a campus psychologist regularly. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I researched communication techniques for people on the autism spectrum and then asked the resident to meet with me privately. 
                    I built a rapport with him, gently drew his attention to certain concerning behaviors, and encouraged him to continue seeing 
                    his counselor. Afterwards, I reassured each of my concerned residents individually, while maintaining his right to privacy. 
                    They understood that I could not disclose additional information and trusted my judgement of the situation. My actions 
                    mollified their unease, incorporated the resident in the solution, and engendered a peaceful outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If not for my composure in the face of uncertainty, willingness to adapt and consider alternative solutions, and innate ability
                    to instill trust and confidence in others, this story would have had a worse ending.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Team Player
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The success of my doctoral and postdoctoral research depended on close collaboration with my colleagues. I worked continuously 
                    with a small, core team of engineers, technicians, and fellow researchers to complete individual project tasks. The integrity 
                    of the group relied on each member actively volunteering for tasks and then dependably completing them. On multiple occasions,
                    when an essential piece of equipment was broken, I met the technician in the wee hours (12-3am) to work on the problem...and 
                    I <u>always</u> showed up. This level of commitment and trust within my team was essential to our efficacy and harmony.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alas, no team has unlimited resources, which meant that I frequently reached out to external experts for advice. In several
                    instances, these contacts became essential team members, contributing time, knowledge, money, and equipment to the project. As
                    these new members were typically not co-located with me, I made a concerted effort to understand their expectations and working 
                    styles and to regularly communicate my progress to them. This process was essential for building trust, maintaining their
                    support, and making our relationship mutually beneficial.

                <p>
                    My move to Taiwan in 2018 was life-changing. I've traveled abroad fairly extensively, but the contrast between being a visitor 
                    and being a resident is stark. One pertinent example was having to adapt to my Taiwanese colleagues' communication styles.
                    During my initial training upon joining the team, I noticed that my guide was uncomfortable giving me direct, critical feedback. 
                    I attributed his behavior to a cultural deference to my perceived authority (as the "higher-educated" person), but found that 
                    it hindered my progress and ability to contribute. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In response, I started watching for covert signs of discontent and asking additional clarifying questions. This slight 
                    behavioral change not only accelerated my learning, but also led me to develop the autonomous data-processing tool that became 
                    my first contribution to the team. With a little sensitivity and flexiblity, I was able to vastly improve our communication 
                    and my productivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have had countless experiences such as this since moving abroad. Each one makes me appreciate both what other cultures can teach 
                    me and that it is <u>my</u> responsibility to adjust, in both life and work, if I am to thrive. I am more 
                    resilient, culturally-sensitive, and patient towards people different from me as a result and I look forward to working with
                    Automattic's diverse workforce.

                <p>
                    On a final note, it is worth mentioning that I'm completely sold on the distributed organizational model. I've worked in a
                    semi-distributed fashion since 2012 and have enjoyed and been productive in that environment. I thrive when given the autonomy to 
                    independently determine when and where I get my work done and am comfortable collaborating asynchronously with colleagues around 
                    the world. In short, my transition to a fully-distributed model will be seamless.

                    I am enticed by the TAM position because it offers a mix of customer interaction, strategic leadership, and problem solving. 
                    My success will depend heavily on my ability to communicate effectively across functions, build and manage client relationships, 
                    and deliver elegant solutions. This is a tall order, by any standards, but my past experiences have prepared me well and I

                    Communication
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My doctoral advisor was unique in his emphasis on cultivating his students' communication skills, particularly technical writing, 
                    oral presentation, and active listening. I spent countless hours pouring over my manuscripts, seeking to clarify my message and
                    condense my thoughts. I delivered dozens of compelling presentations to diverse audiences, big and small, by distilling
                    years of work into 20-30 minutes. Most importantly, however, I met with key stakeholders and external experts, asked good 
                    questions, absorbed their responses, and acted on their advice. These power skills were prominent, though unexpected, benefits 
                    of my graduate education and they continue to benefit both my professional and personal life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Communication is a huge portion of being an Automattician and it is complicated by both the audience diversity and dominance of 
                    lower-bandwidth mediums. The communication skills I've developed over the past decade will allow me to accurately and
                    persuasively represent Automattic to your clients, to advocate internally for their needs, and to capture my work
                    precisely on your internal P2 platform.

                    Project Management
                </h3>
                <p>
                    According to the <a href="https://www.pmi.org/" target="_blank">Project Management Institute</a>, a project is "a temporary 
                    endeavor undertaken to create a unique result." As such, life is full of projects. They can be relatively narrow and personal, 
                    like running a marathon, or gargantuan and professional, like a sending someone to the moon. What's incredible, however, is 
                    that the general approach to all projects, regardless of size, is essentially the same (with caveats for the appropriate
                    methodology applied).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As organizations seek to prepare for and leverage the rapidly changing business environment, managers capable of executing 
                    projects under high-risk, high-uncertainty conditions will be essential to their success. This realization motivated me to 
                    earn my PMP certification in November 2020. Since then, I have continued my education in agile methodologies, as I believe 
                    these will only grow in popularity and utility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond my certification, I also have an extensive history successfully managing large, technical projects. I directly 
                    supervised a 5 to 8-person team at UC San Diego and fostered a positive work culture that led to early project completion. At 
                    UT Austin, I executed a $1M project, within a $100M research portfolio, to great effect, despite the high levels of uncertainty 
                    inherent to cutting-edge research. Finally, in Taiwan, I developed a comprehensive project proposal, gathered support amongst 
                    my colleagues, and produced outstanding results that I will soon publish to mark its completion. This is just a sampling of the 
                    high-profile projects I've been involved in, each of which has been crucial in making me a more effective manager and collaborative
                    team participant.

                    Technical Problem Solving
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I've spent the past 10 years of my career learning new, highly-technical skills. I entered my graduate program knowing nothing 
                    about my research field or the experimental methods I would soon master (some of which didn't exist!). In a relatively short 
                    time, I accumulated a collection of skills (e.g. hardware engineering, mathematical modeling, 3D data analysis and visualization) 
                    uniquely tuned to my research needs and became an expert in my field. I then repeated the process after moving to Taiwan, as I 
                    changed the focus of my research completely and, thus, started from scratch. Through these experiences, I've perfected not only 
                    how to learn from others, but also how to independently teach myself and be productive in ambiguous environments.

                    At a finer scale, my learning experiences are typically linked to a complex problem that I overcame using increasingly elegant 
                    solutions. Since I was a kid disassembling old radios and VCR players, I have been interested in how things work. That curiosity 
                    morphed with age into how to build things and, eventually, into how I could perfect them. This mentality persists to this day 
                    and motivates me as I approach any problem, whether debugging code, troubleshooting an experiment, or detangling complex data. My 
                    need to find the <u>right</u> solution has been critical to my success by driving me to question, experiment, and iterate 
                    continuously.

                    Customer Success
                </h3>
                <p>
                    One of the most powerful business trends for modern SaaS companies is adopting the philosophy that your customers' success 
                    is equivalent to <u>your</u> success. Satisfied clients are more likely to see value in your services, to advocate for its 
                    adoption and expansion internally, and to prioritize it ahead of other expenses. VIP clearly understands this and 
                    I am excited to build symbiotic partnerships with your clients by comprehending their businesses and responding to their 
                    needs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My essential skills and past experiences, outlined above, will allow me to contribute immediately as a member of the TAM 
                    team. In particular, I will:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Connect empathetically with our internal sponsor(s) at newly-onboarded clients to solidify our productive 
                            relationship.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Holistically manage my portfolio of accounts by maintaining their success plan, monitoring risks, and engaging 
                            stakeholders.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Communicate clearly with my clients about their concerns, desires, opportunities, and requests through regular 
                            communication channels (e.g., cadence calls, executive business reviews, and meeting follow-ups).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    This is a modest simplification of the role, but these are all critical aspects of the customer-facing portion of being 
                    a TAM that I am uniquely qualified to excel at.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    The Client-Engineer Interface
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Another prominent contribution to VIP comes with my ability to communicate cross-functionally and build long-term, 
                    positive relationships. I have a strong technical background and have already learned much about WordPress development 
                    independently, but my strength is in translating between the technical and non-technical. I will work with our clients to 
                    define their vision and requirements and then turn to our engineers to collaborate on potential solutions. By communicating
                    clearly, I will ensure the success and impact of your initiatives, which will further tighten the bond between VIP 
                    and its client base and increase the potential for top-down adoption of WordPress within these enterprises.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Strategic Location
                </h3>
                <p class="last">
                    On a practical note, my being located in the APAC timezone, and particularly in Taiwan, brings with it three key strategic 
                    benefits. First, as far as I can discern, less than 15% of Automatticians reside in this timezone and only a handful are
                    VIP TAMs. I would prove a critical point of contact for VIP's current APAC clients. Second, the APAC region 
                    is the fastest growing economic zone in the world with significant opportunities to expand the adoption of VIP and other 
                    services. Taiwan is strategically located, with ready access to all countries, and would prove to be an important operational 
                    base. Finally, Taiwan itself hosts a fledgling WordPress community, but has incredible technical talent just waiting to be 
                    tapped into. I would gladly work with local Automatticians and WordPress contributors to recruit top talent as both volunteers 
                    and employees.

                    You may be wondering, "Dylan, why are you making this career change?" Well, that's a reasonable question, and the answer 
                    is rooted in experiences stretching back to when I was young.                        
                </p>
                <p>
                    I grew up steeped in science and technology. My mom has a PhD in Earth Sciences and met my dad on a research cruise, where he 
                    worked as a marine technician. After my sister and I were born, my mom moved into science education and my dad started a website 
                    consultancy. As such, my childhood was filled with stories of their adventures in far-away places, great science fair projects, and 
                    the wonders of computers and technology. This proved to be a critical foundation for my future education and initial career 
                    goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In college and graduate school, I focused on earth and marine sciences with the goal of working for the US Geological Survey
                    and spending my life at sea, combining adventure and research. Simultaneously, however, I expanded my programming and 
                    technical knowledge by pairing my core education with a B.S. in computer science and performing extensive data modeling,
                    analysis, and visualization in a variety of programming languages. Beyond practical applications for my work, I found writing 
                    algorithms, debugging code, and producing tangible results uniquely satisfying. I have always relished an opportunity to sit 
                    down and code something new and useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite the highly technical nature of my education and work, I also had many opportunities to undertake leadership roles and
                    work with diverse teams. This not only includes the professional work I've mentioned above, but also a myriad of wonderful
                    volunteer opportunities:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://backonmyfeet.org/austin/" target="_blank">Back on my Feet</a> - Associate Board Member</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.gotraustin.org/" target="_blank">Girls on the Run</a> - Running Coach</li>
                        <li><a href="https://tigersplashswim.swimtopia.com/" target="_blank">Dripping Springs Tiger Splash</a> - Assistant Swim Coach</li>

                    </ul>
                <p>
                    Through these experiences, I became aware of how important it is for me to see the impact of my work on others and how 
                    motivated I become when allowed the chance to lead and collaborate.

                    I have enjoyed every step of my journey thus far and appreciate the variety of skills I've developed as an academic. That said, 
                    it is now time to move on to a career that combines my passions for leadership and people with a need for technical 
                    understanding. The TAM position at WordPress VIP is exactly what I have been searching for.
