          <h1>Dylan Meyer, PMP</h1>
          <h2>Project Manager | Team Leader | Engineer</h2>
          <p>
            I am a natural leader and certified project manager (PMP) with 10+ years' involvement in large technical projects that 
            successfully tackled complex, multivariate problems to produce outstanding results.
          </p>
          <p>
            My years in academia earning my doctorate and as a postdoctoral fellow affored me the opportunity to not only learn a diverse 
            set of technical skills (hardware engineering, data analysis, programming), but also an intuitive understanding of how to teach
            myself anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been living and working as a postdoctoral fellow in Taiwan since 2018. My time abroad has improved my appreciation for
            and understanding of other cultures, has made me more resilient and flexible in the face of challenges, and has honed my communication
            and interpersonal skills.
